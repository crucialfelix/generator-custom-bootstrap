# Custom Bootstrap Yeoman Generator


Yeoman generator for installing compass, compass-recipes and bootstrap; set up for immediate customization with live-reload previewing.

- Pare down the bootstrap imports to only the ones your site will use.
- Set google webfonts
- Compass-recipes has lots of things to play with
- Easily add any other compass based libraries

Use bootstrap the way it was meant to be used: as a starting point to customize.
